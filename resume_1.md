## Professional Summary  
Versatile prompt engineering expert specializing in advanced LLM frameworks for recursive reasoning, adversarial testing, and invariant extraction. Founder of Neuresthetics LLC, focusing on engineered epistemology and AI ethics via Steel Man OS—a gated pipeline integrating first principles, analogical extraction, collision, unification, tool-grounded verification, and reduction to core invariants. Expertise in genomic data analysis, including VCF processing and variant phasing on chromosome 1 (~80% SNPs, ~20% indels; proximity clusters like 11bp at 24968116–24968127, het 0/1 phased PS, PASS; no Alzheimer's overlap).

## Professional Experience  
**Founder & CEO**  
Neuresthetics LLC | Portland, OR | June 2017 – Present  
- Architected Steel Man OS framework with 6 gated stages (constructor, seeker, collider, joiner, grounder, kiln), enabling recursive LLM reasoning and fixed-point convergence for invariant outputs.  
- Classified social constructs vs. physical invariants to prevent category errors in AI ethics and prompt processing.  
- Analyzed genomic variants in NEUR-V6-DATA repository: chromosome 1 with ~80% single nucleotide changes and ~20% insertions/deletions; identified proximity clusters (e.g., 11bp group) and distant pairs without Alzheimer's gene links.  
- Applied frameworks to AI intelligence enhancement, consciousness validation, and scientific data, producing grounded, compressible results via empirical tools.  
- Managed full lifecycle from design to open-source deployment on GitHub.  

**Software Developer & Prompt Specialist**  
Independent via Neuresthetics | 2017 – Present  
- Developed adversarial prompt systems for stance synthesis using logic gates, ensuring stable refinements.  
- Processed biological datasets, deriving ethics from physics principles.  
- Structured prompts as declarative JSON programs, with LLMs as interpreters for deterministic execution.  

**U.S. Army Engineer Corps Veteran (Warrior Leader Course Honor Graduate)**  
Various Locations | 2010 – 2014  
- Applied engineering to structural builds, blueprint analysis, and safety protocols, informing AI constraints and pattern recognition.  

**Skilled Carpenter & Construction Professional**  
Various Roles | 2000 – 2025  
- Executed framing, restoration, and masonry tasks under constraints, translating to AI metaphors for grounding and reduction.
