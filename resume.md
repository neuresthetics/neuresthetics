## Professional Summary

Versatile prompt engineering expert with proven expertise in architecting advanced LLM frameworks for recursive reasoning, adversarial synthesis, and invariant extraction. Founder of Neuresthetics LLC, specializing in engineered epistemology and AI ethics through systems like Steel Man OS—a gated pipeline for robust prompt processing integrating first principles, analogical extraction, collision, unification, grounding, and kilning (Invariant Reduction Process (non-essential elements are stripped away through rigorous logical dissolution (using gates like NAND/NOR), leaving only the core, stable truths that hold across contexts—essentially reducing complex outputs to their most fundamental, boolean-stable invariants while handling social constructs separately to avoid errors. This ensures outputs are grounded in base reality, free from ambiguity or dependency on subjective beliefs.)). Repository at github.com/neuresthetics centers on Steel Man project alongside NEUR-V6-DATA for Neuresthetics Theory development, exploring AI, intelligence enhancement, consciousness validation, ideology's impact on intelligence, and integrated analyses of neuresthetics data including genomics, mathematics, algorythm synthesis/breeding, and other technical extensions.

## Professional Experience

**Founder & CEO**  
Neuresthetics LLC | Portland, OR | June 2017 – Present  

- Architected Steel Man OS, a production-grade prompt engineering framework transforming LLMs into recursive, gated reasoning engines: chains Constructor (first principles build), Seeker (analogical extraction for poetic/ideological content), Collider (adversarial smashing), Joiner (unification), Grounder (tool-anchored verification), and Kiln (reduction to core invariants).  
- Classified social constructs (e.g., money, law) vs. physical invariants, preventing category errors in prompt outputs.  
- Evolved framework from seed prompts to v1.2, embedding meta-axioms for self-application, recursion until fixed-point convergence, and universality via logic gates.  
- Developed NEUR-V6-DATA repository for Neuresthetics Theory, incorporating discussions on AI, intelligence enhancement, consciousness validation, and ideology's effects on intelligence; analyzed integrated neuresthetics data, focusing on genomic variants: chromosome 1 dominated by single nucleotide changes (~80%) and insertions/deletions (~20%); identified clusters of close variants (e.g., an 11-base pair group) and distant pairs with no links to Alzheimer's disease genes.  
- Applied to AI ethics, unified theories, and scientific data processing, yielding compressible, invariant outputs bounded by empirical tools and hardening protocols.  
- Managed full lifecycle: design, implementation, evaluation, and open-source via GitHub, centering repo on Steel Man tools and NEUR-V6-DATA for theoretical development.  

**Software (thoughtware?) Developer & Prompt Specialist**  
(Independent Projects via Neuresthetics) | 2017 – Present  

- Developed SteelMenCollider, an adversarial prompt system, self-recursive, for fragmenting/synthesizing stances via logic gates, ensuring stable refinements.  
- Leveraged construction background for analogies in prompt design (e.g., "pipeline as industrial processing line" for robust chaining).  
- Processed biological data sets, progress in ethics derived form physics.
- My take: The central idea is that prompts are not just conversational inputs but can be structured, deterministic programs written in a declarative language (like JSON). The LLM acts as the interpreter or runtime for this language.

**U.S. Army Engineer Corps Veteran (Honor Graduate)**  
Various Locations | Dates Not Specified  

- Applied engineering principles to structural builds, blueprint reading, and safety protocols—informing AI frameworks with real-world constraints and pattern recognition.  

**Skilled Carpenter & Construction Professional**  
Various Roles | 10+ Years  

- Executed precision tasks in framing, restoration, and masonry, honing skills in problem-solving under constraints and quality control—translated to AI via metaphors for "anchoring" prompts to reality and "dissolving" non-essentials.  

## Key Projects

**My Pre-AI code: (GitHub: [neuresthetics/graphtacular](https://github.com/neuresthetics/graphtacular))**

- This Graph has Vertices that have Kernels which are given Strands. Strands passed into Kernels, which contain a reference to the Vertex that is inside. Vertices have references to the matrix they are inside. So a Kernel can operate in terms of all the Vertices in the graph it's in. The Graph is structured like this:

**Steel Man Prompt Structure (GitHub: [neuresthetics/steel_man_s.e](https://github.com/neuresthetics/steel_man_s.e))**  
- Unified prompt pipeline for axiomatic processing: mandatory stages with recursive self-feed, halting on invariance.  
- Default mode: Reduction—dissolves social dependencies, yielding boolean outputs for base-reality verification.  

**Neurology and Schema Related (GitHub: [neuresthetics/NEUR-V6-DATA](https://github.com/neuresthetics/NEUR-V6-DATA))**  

- Development repository for sixth Neuresthetics Theory rendition, featuring Markdown discussions on AI, intelligence enhancement, consciousness validation, and ideology's impact on intelligence. Comes with functions code, but information and analysis heavy.
