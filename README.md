#### Neuro - relating to nerves or nervous system
#### Aesthetic - relating to perception by the sneses
### "Neuresthetic" - relating to learning of the nerves through perception of the senses.

Take 'kinesthetic' for example: in which a person observes the geometry and function of their body in terms of efficient motion. Neuresthetic is the same principle applied to neurology.</br>

Not to be confused with "neuroaesthetics" such as [this](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/23/1/53/4981/Neuroaesthetics-A-Coming-of-Age-Story), and [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7075503/), which is the study of your brain on art.</br>

"Sensing" of neurological operation is done externally and internally. One-to-one personal scans serve for personal applications such as treatment and diagnostics. Many-to-one scans take the form of brain network theory design principles as compressed representation of the many so that it may fit in one.  Internal sense is driven by proprioception tech. As the mind and brain draw each other, having new external autological data opens new autological abilities such as mass manufactured genii.</br>
