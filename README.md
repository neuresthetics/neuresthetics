#### Neuro - relating to nerves or nervous system
#### Aesthetic - relating to perception by the senses
### "Neuresthetic" - relating to learning of the nerves through perception of the senses.

Take 'kinesthetic' for example: in which a person observes the geometry and function of their body in terms of efficient motion. Neuresthetic is the same principle applied to neurology.</br>

Not to be confused with "neuroaesthetics" such as [this](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/23/1/53/4981/Neuroaesthetics-A-Coming-of-Age-Story), and [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7075503/), which is the study of your brain on art.</br>

Brain network theory design principles from aggregate brain data are a compressed representation of the many for the observation of a one. As the mind and brain draw each other, increasing autological sense and analysis increases autological abilities up to such things as mass manufactured genii.</br>
