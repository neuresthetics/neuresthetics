#### Neuro - relating to nerves or nervous system
#### Aesthetic - relating to perception by the senses
### "Neuresthetic" [ðŸŽ§](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=neuresthetic&op=translate) - relating to learning of the nerves through perception of the senses.

Take "kinesthetics" for example: in which a person observes the geometry and function of their body in terms of efficient motion. Neuresthetics is the same principle applied to neurology.</br>

<!-- Not to be confused with "neuroaesthetics" such as [this](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/23/1/53/4981/Neuroaesthetics-A-Coming-of-Age-Story), and [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7075503/), which is the study of your brain on art.</br> -->
