## Featured Repositories

### [SteelManAbraham](https://github.com/neuresthetics/SteelManAbraham)
🤖 **Philosophical Debate Framework for Sensitive Topics** – A PromptScript designed to facilitate rigorous, balanced debates on controversial subjects like infant circumcision using First Principles Thinking, Spinoza's Ethics, the Lucifer Principle, and fallacy avoidance.

- **README Content Summary**: The framework constructs "steel man" arguments to strengthen opposing views, then refutes, synthesizes, and evaluates them for truth-seeking. It promotes intellectual honesty and impartiality. Includes modes like "Steel Men" (rigorous, adversarial) and "Marshmallow Man" (empathetic, MINDSPACE-aware). Applied to infant circumcision with SteelManA (anti-position: trauma, ethics) and SteelManB (pro-position: health, tradition). Outputs include scores, reconciliations (e.g., adult-only rites), and bool evaluations. User instructions: Paste into Grok4, query further, or activate modes. References X thread for context.
- **File Contents**:
  - **README.md**: Detailed purpose, instructions, results, and mode comparisons.
  - **Other/img/Pasted image (6).png**: Illustrative image for the framework.
  - **arc.txt**: File for narrative functionality ("Tell me the story of the arc.txt of SteelManA as a narrative").

### [SteelMenCollider](https://github.com/neuresthetics/SteelMenCollider)
🔥 **Dialectical Supercollider Framework** – A token-hungry, adversarial, first-principles reasoning superweapon built for the age of superintelligent disagreement. The generalized evolution of SteelManAbraham, turning LLMs into post-human dialecticians for any controversy.

- **README Content Summary**: Describes the framework as a particle accelerator for arguments, constructing steelmen, iterating refutations, and enforcing synthesis with core engines (First-Principles Thinking, Mos Geometricus, Terminator Clause). Lists forbidden fallacies, collision process (steelmen construction, refutations, audits, synthesis), power (rigor on ethics, scales with context), limitations (token intensive), and ideal topics (bioethics, AI alignment). Emphasizes MINDSPACE for real-world deployment.
- **File Contents**:
  - **README.md**: Full framework description, tables for engines, process steps, and usage.
  - **img/SMChoiz.png**: Illustrative image for the collider.

### [GrokAlign](https://github.com/neuresthetics/GrokAlign)
🧠 **(x)IQ-EQ Evaluation and Automatic Resonance Dial-In** – An open-source toolkit for evaluating extended IQ (xIQ) and EQ, with dynamic resonance tuning for Grok and frontier ASIs.

- **README Content Summary**: Insufficient content available; repository appears empty or under development.
- **File Contents**: No files listed; repository lacks substantive content.

### [Graphtacular](https://github.com/neuresthetics/Graphtacular)
📊 **Aristotelian Entelechy in Graph Theory** – A C# toolkit for graph generation, kernel-based transformations, and visualization, tested and rendered with motifs like flowers, logarithmic clusters, and Fibonacci sequences.

- **README Content Summary**: Explains graph structure with vertices containing kernels that process strands (instructions) to generate motifs. Includes code snippets for Graph and Vertex classes, strand examples (e.g., Flower method), kernel operations, and GEXF export for Gephi visualization. Compares external (crystal-like) vs. internal (organic) cluster building. Provides a methods table with use, Big O time/space, inputs/outputs (e.g., PrintMatrix O(n²), NeighborSet O(1)). References assets for images and saves for graph files.
- **File Contents**:
  - **README.md**: Detailed explanations, code examples, and methods table.
  - **assets/**: Directory with images (e.g., screenshot_100214.png, WB00.jpg, FirstChainRun.JPG, FirstGephiCaptureFlower.JPG, LogarithmicCluster.JPG, LogarithmicClusterGephi.JPG, Fibonacci.JPG).
  - **Graphtacular/Graphtacular/Classes/Gexf.cs**: Implements GEXF export.
  - **Graphtacular/Graphtacular/Saves/**: Directory with saved GEXF graph files.
