# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jason Burns

Founder of **Neuresthetics LLC**, pioneering the field of neurocognitive optimization at the crossroads of neuroscience, philosophy, and aesthetic engineering.

**Neuresthetic** (adj.): Schema engineered/engineering in respect to the shape and function of the brain.

I'm dedicated to uncovering neurocognitive advantages that can elevate human potential. My research delves into how traits like handedness (especially left-handed or ambidextrous) and belief systems (such as pantheism) influence brain bottlenecks, including the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) and Corpus Callosum (CC), to enhance interhemispheric communication, creativity, and holistic thinking. By analyzing data from historical and modern geniusesâ€”curated with AI to reduce biasâ€”I explore ways to emulate genius-level cognition through training and philosophical shifts.

### [15.58x More Likely to Be a Genius: The Impact of Handedness and Pantheism on Cognitive Abilities](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15653389)
- **Date:** June 8, 2025  
- **Abstract:** This study examines a sample of 100 AI-selected geniuses, revealing a 15.58x overrepresentation of left-handed or ambidextrous individuals with pantheistic beliefs (7.59% vs. expected 0.5%). We propose this combo optimizes brain connectivity via the PCC and CC, acting as a "bottleneck" for unified thought. Interventions like handedness training and adopting pantheistic views could boost cognitive flexibility via neuroplasticity. Includes experimental proposals for neuroimaging and behavioral studies.  
- **Key Insights:** Data compiled from public sources using AI (Grok) to generate a table of 100 geniuses, analyzing handedness, spiritual disposition, and % likeness to pantheism/scientifically literate theology. Examples include Albert Einstein (Left-handed, Cosmic religion, 80%) and Leonardo da Vinci (Left-handed, Christian, 60%). Full table and analysis available in the repo.
