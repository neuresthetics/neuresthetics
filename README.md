This is a collection of code and papers based on a body of research I've named neuresthetics.

NEURESTHETIC (adj.) Schema and education modeling in terms of the way the brain is shaped.

>neuro: word-forming element meaning ‚Äúpertaining to a nerve or nerves or the nervous system,‚Äù from Greek neura
