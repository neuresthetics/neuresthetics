# **Evolutionary Lineage of the Cognitive Engine**

Neuresthetics is not a single project.  
It is an **evolutionary lineage** of cognitive engines — each one producing the next.

Below is the developmental flow, with each stage linked directly to its repository.

---

## **🌱 1. V6 — Background Research 2017-**  
**Repo:** [`https://github.com/neuresthetics/NEUR-V6-DATA`](https://github.com/neuresthetics/NEUR-V6-DATA)

V6 established the conceptual foundation:

- recursive epistemology  
- coherence, contradiction, and tension  
- cognitive bottlenecks  
- graph‑theoretic reasoning  
- early operator intuitions  

This is the **pre‑formal discovery** stage — the substrate from which everything else emerged.

## **🧱 2. SteelManAbraham — First Object Literal**  
(Repo link intentionally commented out)
<!-- **Repo:** [`https://github.com/neuresthetics/SteelManAbraham`](https://github.com/neuresthetics/SteelManAbraham) -->

SteelManAbraham is the first time the steel‑man concept became **concrete**.

It introduced:

- the first *object literal* steel man  
- the first *data structure* for a steel man  
- the first *schema hint*  
- the first *phenotype* of the idea  

This is where the abstract concept became **encoded and manipulable**.

## **🔨 3. SteelMenCollider — First Topic‑Agnostic Collider**

(outdated, but foundational, reborn from seed)

(Repo link intentionally commented out)
<!-- **Repo:** [`https://github.com/neuresthetics/SteelMenCollider`](https://github.com/neuresthetics/SteelMenCollider) -->

With a literal steel man defined, the next step was operational:

> This is when I realized I could pass the "collider" into itself.

>There are a multitude of failures between here and spinoza_lab, which can be found in the junkDrawer.

SteelMenCollider introduced:

- the first procedural collider  
- the first “smash and refine” loop  
- the first proto‑pipeline  
- the first generalization of the steel‑man idea  

This is where the system became **mechanical and iterative**.

---

## **📐 4. Spinoza Lab — First Formal Operator**  
**Repo:** [`https://github.com/neuresthetics/spinoza_lab`](https://github.com/neuresthetics/spinoza_lab)

*(formerly Neuresthetics‑Forge)*

SteelMenCollider provided the mechanism.  
Spinoza Lab provided the **formalism**.

Inspired by Spinoza’s geometric method, this phase produced:

- the first axiomatic reasoning engine  
- the first geometric logic structure  
- the first structured steel‑man literal  
- the first proto‑DSL for reasoning  

This is where reasoning became **axiomatic, structured, and auditable**.

## **🔁 5. The Seed — Recursive Cognitive Kernel**  
**Repo:** [`https://github.com/neuresthetics/seed`](https://github.com/neuresthetics/seed)

The Seed is the inflection point.

It is:

- a recursive, self‑applicable reasoning program  
- written in JSON as a declarative AST  
- capable of self‑evaluation and self‑improvement  
- built on invariants, gates, recursion, and evaluation metrics  
- the first system that can **generate the next system**  

The Seed is a **metaprogram** — the cognitive kernel of the entire architecture.

This is where “prompts as programs” became operational reality.

| Sub-Repo | Domain | Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[sprouts](https://github.com/neuresthetics/sprouts)** | various seed branches. | A semi version organized, highlight documented, evolution of seeds. |

## **⚙️ 6. Steel Man Collider Pipeline — Full Cognitive OS**
**Repo:** [`https://github.com/neuresthetics/steel_man_s.e`](https://github.com/neuresthetics/steel_man_s.e)


From the Seed emerged a full cognitive operating system:

- **Constructor**  
- **Seeker**  
- **Collider**  
- **Joiner**  
- **Grounder**  
- **Kiln**  
- orchestration logic  
- recursion rules  
- invariants  
- evaluation metrics  

This is the first **multi‑operator cognitive architecture** in the ecosystem.

It is modular, composable, recursive, and self‑correcting — a general reasoning engine designed for high‑stakes conceptual work.

# Neuresthetics

**Kinesthetics for brains** — spelled with “eu”, never “neuroesthetics.”

Neuresthetics is the practice of deliberately shaping neural architecture through objective, species-wide principles of brain organization and dynamics. Rather than passive reflection, it uses aggregated neuroscience data (connectomes, plasticity rules, network theory) to guide targeted behaviors that enhance integration, reduce fragmentation, and expand cognitive capacity.

The design pattern is a loop: **consuming objective data → guiding subjective behavior → achieving a desired effect**. This substrate-agnostic framework has been industrialized into a research methodology and adapted to model AI systems, biological pathways, and mathematical frontiers.
