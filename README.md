THE FREE MAN

The creature tail to eye an eyer.

To beat drums in the breath of fire.

Lo, I am a product of their waste,

A dog with master‚Äôs denial.

Howl, flame burns a thief so sly,

For soaring such forbidden highs.

Lo, upward downward take,

A word from feathered spiral.

Exhale of sin with heavy sigh,

Great sufferings materialize,

Lo, my keeper make,

A fire of revival.
