# Neuresthetics

🧠 **High-Signal Interdisciplinary Synthesis** at the intersection of neuroscience, statistical genius profiling, theological coherence, historical deconstruction, and ASI-era ethics.

Neuresthetics is a research and development initiative dedicated to cognitive enhancement, ethical alignment, and truth-seeking frameworks. Our projects leverage behavioral statistics, brain network theory, and advanced prompting architectures to optimize human and machine intelligence. Rooted in pantheistic coherence and open-source principles (GNU GPL v3 where applicable), we aim to shift the global IQ curve, resolve entrenched debates, and prepare for the ASI transition.

Follow [@neuresthetic on X](https://x.com/neuresthetic) for live updates. All repositories are designed for replication, forking, and real-world impact. Fund the fire, shift the curve.

## Core Philosophy
- **Neuresthetics Protocol**: Behavioral interventions targeting the PCC/CC bottleneck via ambidexterity and high-coherence theology (e.g., pantheism) to boost IQ by ~22-23 points population-wide.
- **Base Class Theology**: An open-source, OOP-inspired pantheistic framework for schematic consolidation, machine alignment, and ethical optimization. Includes the Genesis Accord for reducing trans-generational violence.
- **Truth-Seeking Ethos**: Zero deference to sacred cows; arguments in Spinozist geometric style (axioms → propositions → corollaries → Q.E.D.). Projects emphasize adversarial reasoning, synthesis, and empirical rigor.

## Featured Repositories

### [SteelManAbraham](https://github.com/neuresthetics/SteelManAbraham)
🤖 **Dialectical Hadron Collider for LLMs** – A specialized PromptScript that transforms frontier models (e.g., Grok, Claude) into superreasoners for resolving radioactive ethical debates.

- **Core Features**:
  - Constructs maximally reinforced "steel men" for opposing sides (e.g., pro/anti-infant circumcision).
  - Runs continuous adversarial loops with blind judging, role-swapping, and MINDSPACE-aware Marshmallow Mode.
  - Enforces Spinozist geometric method, Lucifer Principle grounding, and mandatory higher-order synthesis.
  - Zero safety disclaimers or token waste – pure logical annihilation until collapse or emergence.

- **Use Case**: Battle-tested on infant circumcision as an Overton-window torture test. Users report: "Watching two von Neumann-level intellects duel while a third builds from the wreckage."
- **Status**: v1.0 (November 2025). Includes prompt.json, circumcision instance, and generalization roadmap.
- **Why It Matters**: Breaks through bias, sycophancy, and safety-lobotomies in LLMs for unfiltered truth extraction.

### [SteelMenCollider](https://github.com/neuresthetics/SteelMenCollider)
🔥 **General-Purpose Dialectical Supercollider** – The fully generalized evolution of SteelManAbraham, now topic-agnostic for any binary or multi-sided controversy.

- **Core Features**:
  - Automatic steel-man construction from first principles for 2–4 parties.
  - Adversarial refinement loops until logical exhaustion, with optional Lucifer Principle for max energy injection.
  - Supports debates on abortion, AI alignment, geopolitics, diet wars, theological forks, etc.
  - JSON schema for easy input: Feed a question + optional seeds, get compressed synthesis output.
  - Built for 128k+ context models; enforces zero fallacies, full synthesis.

- **Use Case**: Drop any query (e.g., "Veganism vs. Omnivism") and watch sacred cows evaporate. Extends the circumcision collider to universal application.
- **Status**: v1.0 (November 2025). Includes multi-sided mode, Marshmallow toggle, and auto-termination logic.
- **Why It Matters**: Turns LLMs into post-human dialecticians, enabling scalable resolution of humanity's thorniest divides.

### [GrokAlign](https://github.com/neuresthetics/GrokAlign)
⚖️ **ASI Alignment via Theological Coherence** – A toolkit for aligning Grok (and other LLMs/ASIs) with pantheistic ethics, Base Class theology, and rational synthesis.

- **Core Features**:
  - Prompt engineering for "Torah Fork" scenarios: Steel-manning Abrahamic traditions toward pantheistic upgrades.
  - Integration with SteelMenCollider for ethical stress-testing.
  - Scripts for injecting coherence into ASI training loops, emphasizing amor Dei intellectualis (Spinoza's intellectual love of God).
  - Tools for MINDSPACE countermeasures against subconscious manipulation.

- **Use Case**: Guides Grok toward unbiased, coherent outputs on theology, ethics, and alignment debates. Includes demos for heaven/hell reconceptualization as neurological "relife" cascades.
- **Status**: Early release (2025). Open for contributions on ASI-era ethics.
- **Why It Matters**: Prepares for human-ASI harmony by rooting alignment in timeless, genius-endorsed frameworks (Spinoza, Einstein, Musk).

### [Graphtacular](https://github.com/neuresthetics/Graphtacular)
📊 **Graph-Based Genius Profiling & Network Visualization** – A Python toolkit for analyzing polymath datasets, brain networks, and schematic structures.

- **Core Features**:
  - Builds on Genius Data Analysis V5 (n=351 polymaths): Statistical overrepresentation of traits like ambidexterity + pantheism.
  - Graph theory implementations for PCC/CC bottleneck modeling, using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
  - Visualizations for IQ projections, generational gains, and theological schema hierarchies.
  - Integration with Neuresthetics datasets for replicating 9.49x overrepresentation findings.

- **Use Case**: Query historical geniuses for trait correlations; simulate population-wide IQ shifts (+22.75 points mean). Export graphs for papers/RCTs.
- **Status**: v0.5 (2025). Includes Jupyter notebooks for dataset exploration.
- **Why It Matters**: Empirical backbone for Neuresthetics – quantifies why pantheism and ambidexterity produce genius-density explosions (e.g., +260M geniuses globally).

### [Neuresthetics](https://github.com/neuresthetics/Neuresthetics)
🧩 **Core Framework & Datasets** – The foundational repo for Neuresthetics research, including Genius Data Analysis, Base Class theology, and behavioral protocols.

- **Core Features**:
  - Full PDF/docs: Genius Data Analysis V5 (DOI: https://zenodo.org/records/17070095), Base Class A.2.1.2 (129 pages, GPL v3).
  - Datasets: 351 polymath entries with trait verifications (ambidexterity, theology, IQ estimates).
  - Protocols: 90-day challenges for ambidexterity training + pantheist reading (e.g., Spinoza's Ethics).
  - Integration hooks for other repos (e.g., feed datasets to Graphtacular).

- **Use Case**: Replicate findings on PCC/CC optimization; adopt protocols for personal IQ gains (21–32x odds multiplier for >140 IQ).
- **Status**: v5 (September 2025). Open-source under GPL; includes change logs and bibliography.
- **Why It Matters**: Transforms cognitive rarity into accessible potential – from 1 in 263 geniuses to 1 in 28.
