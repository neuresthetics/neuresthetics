# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jason Burns

Founder of Neuresthetics LLC, pioneering the field of neurocognitive optimization at the crossroads of neuroscience, philosophy, and cognitive engineering.

**Neuresthetic** (adj.): Pertaining to nerves, involving reverse engineering macro brain architecture using thoughts and behaviors. This field focuses on neural schemas and cognitive engineering for intelligence, emphasizing the structural and functional aspects of the brain.

I'm dedicated to uncovering neurocognitive advantages that can elevate human potential. My research explores how behavioral interventions, such as promoting ambidexterity and adopting coherent theological frameworks (e.g., pantheism), can exploit the brain's central bottleneckâ€”the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and corpus callosum (CC)â€”to enhance interhemispheric communication, reduce cognitive dissonance, and boost overall intelligence capacity within the default mode network (DMN).

By analyzing data from 301 historical geniuses and polymaths, curated to minimize bias and include diverse cultural figures, I demonstrate significant overrepresentations of key traits like mixed-handedness and high-coherence theologies, suggesting causal levers for cognitive enhancement.

### Genius Data Analysis V4
* **Date:** August 24, 2025
* **Abstract:** In the intricate architecture of the human brain, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and its interhemispheric conduit, the corpus callosum (CC), form a central bottleneck that governs entity processing, self-referential thought, and schematic efficiency within the default mode network (DMN). This paper introduces Neuresthetics, a behavioral intervention leveraging brain network theory and statistical patterns from exceptional intellects to exploit this bottleneck for enhanced cognitive capacity. By promoting ambidexterity to thicken the CC and adopting coherent theological frameworksâ€”such as pantheismâ€”to minimize dissonant loads on the PCC, Neuresthetics aligns mental schemas with neural topology, potentially shifting the IQ distribution rightward by 22-23 points upon universal adoption. Drawing on historical genius data (n=301) and AI extrapolations, we demonstrate a 33-fold overrepresentation of these traits among polymaths, with projections indicating a surge in genius per capita from 0.0038 to 0.125. Longitudinal implications suggest compounding generational gains, transforming cognitive rarity into accessible potential and underscoring the brain's plasticity as a gateway to collective advancement.
* **Key Insights:** 
  - Dataset of 301 geniuses, expanded from Catherine M. Cox's 1926 study to include non-Western figures (e.g., Aryabhata, Ibn Sina, Confucius) for reduced bias.
  - Variables: Estimated IQ, primary/alternate religions, religious classification, theological coherency score (1-100, higher for rational, science-compatible frameworks like pantheism/deism/atheism), handedness (Left, Ambidextrous, Right), and certainty.
  - Overrepresentations: Ambidexterity at 4.3% (vs. 1% baseline), high-coherence theology at 29.2% (vs. 5%), optimal combination at 1.7% (vs. 0.05%), yielding a 33-fold enrichment.
  - Analysis Grid (3x2: Handedness by Theology Score):
    
    | Handedness \ Theology Score | 1-79 (Low) | 80-100 (High) |
    |-----------------------------|------------|---------------|
    | **Left**                    | Prevalence: 15<br>Expected: 21<br>Ratio: 0.71 | Prevalence: 10<br>Expected: 9<br>Ratio: 1.11 |
    | **Ambidextrous**            | Prevalence: 8<br>Expected: 2.1<br>Ratio: 3.81 | Prevalence: 5<br>Expected: 0.9<br>Ratio: 5.56 |
    | **Right**                   | Prevalence: 190<br>Expected: 187.5<br>Ratio: 1.01 | Prevalence: 73<br>Expected: 80.4<br>Ratio: 0.91 |

  - Projections: Universal adoption could shift mean IQ by 22.75 points, increasing >140 IQ individuals from ~30 million to ~1.01 billion globally.
  - Neurological Basis: PCC as the brain's most central hub for entity mapping, bisected across hemispheres with CC as sub-bottleneck; ambidexterity thickens CC by 10-15%, coherent beliefs reduce load.
