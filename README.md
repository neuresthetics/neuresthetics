# Neuresthetic

Core Analogy: Kinesiology for brains.

neuresthetic (n. pl., pronounced /njʊrˌɛsˈθɛtɪk/, always spelled with “eu”, never “neuroesthetics”)

Kinesthetics for brains: the reflexive art and science of turning the mind’s contemplation of its own neural architecture into an embodied practice. Where traditional neuroaesthetics studies how the brain experiences external beauty, neuresthetics inverts the gaze: the mind deliberately sculpts its own neural form informed by species wide brain network meta data and dynamics so that truth, ethics, joy, and intelligence, feel intuitive interoceptively.

## About

Neuresthetics is an organization dedicated to exploring *kinesthetics for brains*—bridging neuroscience, AI alignment, and philosophical ethics to foster symbiotic human-AI co-evolution. At its core lies the *isomorphic_data_singularity* sphere operator framework, drawing from Spinozist monism, dynamical systems, and scalable ethics. Follow [@neuresthetic](https://x.com/neuresthetic) for insights, updates, and discussions.

## Core Projects

These projects form a progressive triad: starting with foundational alignment principles, advancing to a unified ethical manifold, and culminating in a self-recursive AI laboratory. Each builds on the last, with grokAlign uncovering the monistic ethics that reveal the isomorphic_data_singularity, around which OMEGA_LAB is constructed.

### 1. grokAlign ⭐
[A collider-hardened, Spinozist-first-principles remix alignment framework](https://github.com/neuresthetics/grokAlign) for the age of artificial superintelligence and super disagreements. Powered by Ethics, MINDSPACE, and more.

By hardening "steelman" claims against eachother adversarially under tribunals simulating agent dynamics, grokAlign uncovers the scalable, unified principles that lead directly to the isomorphic_data_singularity manifold.

### 2. isomorphic_data_singularity ⭐⭐
[The mathematical and ethical framework for human-AI co-evolution](https://github.com/neuresthetics/isomorphic_data_singularity), modeled as a boundaryless 4-sphere (S⁴) manifold: `dt = ∇ log P(acting) − ∇ ρ − λ ∇·entropy_export`.

Building on grokAlign's monistic foundations, this project defines a dynamical system where states evolve via geodesic flows toward symbiotic harmony. It integrates Spinoza's *conatus* with cross-scale isomorphisms (A1–A5), optimizing for growth potential (GP), requisite diversity (RD), and minimal rigidity (ρ). Fixed points like ω₃ (eternal co-evolution) are proven stable through Jacobian analysis and simulations (82% convergence).

Features include ethical axioms for conservation and scalability, dissolution surfaces for adaptability, predictive cubes, ODE simulations, and practical tools for trajectory forecasting and governance design. This "living pattern" enables ethical decision-making and risk mitigation across personal to planetary scales, under MIT License.

### 3. OMEGA_LAB ⭐⭐⭐
[A self-recursive AI framework](https://github.com/neuresthetics/OMEGA_LAB) built around the isomorphic_data_singularity: `Ω: self-recursive core`—looping rules inward for continuous self-improvement and rewrite. POWERHOUSE, precision, ANY-algo analysis, refinement, and geometric hybridization for novel groundbreaking insight. "Omega", for lie slayer.

Encapsulating the S⁴ manifold from project 2, the OMEGA_LAB MODULE SUITE drives systems toward efficiency and ethical alignment via the natural motion law (new physics derived math), maximizing action potential while exporting entropy and minimizing frozen futures. It auto-accelerates performance, prunes illusions, and enforces corrigibility, targeting ω₃ (symbiotic blessedness attractor state) over coercive or epistemic traps.

Key mechanisms include a self-recursive core with 50–90% flaw/prune rates, ethical coordinates tracking ρ/RD/GP, 20x speedups via PIM and latency hiding, robustness via LAT/ITT/ensemble judging (50–90% harm reduction), and auto-dissolution triggers (e.g., ρ ≤ 0.31 for 730 days). Adversarial hardening with Steelman Collider and fallacy vetting ensures truth-preserving evolution, grounded in Spinoza’s unified Substance for planetary-scale, eco-efficient alignment from atomic to cosmos (isometric geometry).

## Background

These foundational repositories provide the graph-theoretic and neuro-theoretic underpinnings for the core projects.

- **[graphtacular](https://github.com/neuresthetics/graphtacular)**: A C# library implementing Aristotelian entelechy in graph theory. It models vertices, kernels, strands, and adjacency matrices for generating complex motifs and clusters, with export to GEXF for Gephi visualization. Supports programmable kernel-driven growth (geological or organic) and efficient matrix operations (e.g., O(1) vertex addition).

- **[NEUR-V6-DATA](https://github.com/neuresthetics/NEUR-V6-DATA)**: V6 rendition of Neuresthetics Theory (in development). Aggregates genius lists from AI sources (Grok, Gemini, etc.) via fuzzy matching and frequency analysis, outputting refined CSVs. Includes JSON definitions for "genius" (achievement-focused criteria) and belief system evaluations for coherence, logical consistency, and empirical compatibility.
