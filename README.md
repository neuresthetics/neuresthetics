# Neuresthetics

**Kinesthetics for brains** — spelled with “eu”, never “neuroesthetics.”

Neuresthetics is the practice of deliberately shaping neural architecture through objective, species-wide principles of brain organization and dynamics. Rather than passive reflection, it uses aggregated neuroscience data (connectomes, plasticity rules, network  theory) to guide targeted behaviors that enhance integration, reduce  fragmentation, and expand cognitive capacity.

The design pattern is the loop formed by consuming objective meta brain network data subjectively to inform behavioral and schematic changes for desired effect.

For details, see V6 (and V5 for history)

The framework is substrate-agnostic and has been adapted to AI systems for recursive self-improvement via impartial evaluation mechanisms.


# 📁 Featured Projects

## Core:

🧠 **[NEUR-V6-DATA](https://github.com/neuresthetics/NEUR-V6-DATA)**  
Core repository for Neuresthetics theory and protocols. It documents principles and training methods for reducing structural bottlenecks in brain networks, leveraging natural plasticity to improve coherence and efficiency in thinking patterns. Additional papers on conciousness, information theory, and AI.

🔬 **[spinoza_lab](https://github.com/neuresthetics/spinoza_lab)**  
Tools and models for recursive hardening of ideas through structured dialectical testing. Builds directly on Neuresthetics training loops to strengthen concepts by identifying hard-to-vary patterns across domains. Supports both human and AI use, fostering clearer reasoning and robust ethical frameworks.

🌿 **[seed](https://github.com/neuresthetics/seed)**  
BEGINNER FRIENDLY OPEN SOURCE An Aristotelian entelechy prompt in thestyle of Gödel, Spinoza, and Deutsch. You can use it as is, or feed this program into itself over and over and make a better program for remaking programs, or, you can feed into itself with something else, and it will specialize for handling that thing.

## Research Labs:

The following repos are problem domain specific evolutions of neuresthetics powered spinoza_lab using architecture similar to or evolved from "seed".

🔢 **[riemann_hypothesis](https://github.com/neuresthetics/riemann_hypothesis)**  
From first principles: The Riemann Hypothesis (RH) posits that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function lie on Re(s) = 1/2. This tree organizes the heuristic synthesis from the documents into a deductive-like structure, starting from irreducible axioms (zeta properties, primes, etc.), branching through propositions (pathways like spectral, Langlands), derivations (unifications, convergences), and culminating in the fixed-point conclusion.

💊 **[alzheimer's disease: amyloid_aggregation_insights](https://github.com/neuresthetics/AmyloidAggregationInsights)**  
Application of the multi-scale isomorphic framework to amyloid aggregation dynamics.

🧬 **[rapid_protein_folding_pathways](https://github.com/neuresthetics/Rapid-Protein-Folding-Pathways)**  
Comprehensive suite for analyzing and simulating rapid protein folding pathways.

🧬 **[alzheimer's disease: multidimensional_DNA_analysis](https://github.com/neuresthetics/multidimensional_DNA_analysis)**    
Framework for advancing Alzheimer's disease risk prediction through multidimensional DNA analysis.

💡 **[theory_of_everything_so_far: "collision mathematics"](https://github.com/neuresthetics/TOESF_theory_of_everything_so_far)**     
Tinkering with "seed" like prompting in the axiomatic breakdown and buildup of the laws of nature.
