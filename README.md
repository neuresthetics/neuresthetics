  Here's an idea.</br>
  FROM genius minds SELECT behavioral overlap WHERE behavior positively impacts large scale brain network architecture.</br>
  For example: DaVinci, Turing, Tesla, and Einstein, were all ambidextrous pantheists. Coincidence?! Nope. Causal clustering.</br>
  These behaviors are incredibly rare to appear in the same individual along with everything else necessary to produce genius.</br>
  Being statistically rare naturally, and even more so together, we can choose to combine them for our benefit.</br>
  This doesn't mean that practicing them together will make you a genius, but it will significantly increase your processing ability.</br>
  Although, someone who is near-genius may very well have a breakthrough.</br>
  Imagine standardizing these behaviors across a population and seeing the entire bell curve shift.</br>
  IMO, a society which does not do this, will fail to compete with one which does.</br>
  IMO, we need to accelerate the intelligence increase to solve the challenges of the future.</br>

#### Neuro - relating to nerves or nervous system
#### Aesthetic - relating to perception by the senses
### "Neuresthetic" [ðŸŽ§](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=neuresthetic&op=translate) - relating to learning of the nerves through perception of the senses.

Take "kinesthetics" for example: in which a person observes the geometry and function of their body in terms of efficient motion.</br>
Neuresthetics is the same principle applied to neurology.</br>
A neurethetic neuresthesiologist practices neuresthetics.</br>

<!-- Not to be confused with "neuroaesthetics" such as [this](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/23/1/53/4981/Neuroaesthetics-A-Coming-of-Age-Story), and [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7075503/), which is the study of your brain on art.</br> -->
