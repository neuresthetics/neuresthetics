#### Neuro - relating to nerves or nervous system
#### Aesthetic - relating to perception by the senses
### "Neuresthetic" [ðŸŽ§](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=neuresthetic&op=translate) - relating to learning of the nerves through perception of the senses.

Take "kinesthetics" for example: in which a person observes the form and function of their body in terms of efficient motion.</br>
Neuresthetics is the same principle applied to neurology. A neurethetic neuresthesiologist practices neuresthetics.</br>


 ### Here's the idea:</br>
<p>
  FROM genius minds SELECT behavioral overlap WHERE behavior positively impacts large scale brain network architecture.</br>
  For example: DaVinci, Turing, Tesla, and Einstein, were all ambidextrous pantheists. Coincidence?! Nope. Causal clustering.</br>
  These behaviors are among the rarest to appear in the same individual along with everything else necessary to produce genius.</br>
  What was once happenstance to appear together, can now be chosen.</br>
  This doesn't mean that embodying them together will automatically make one a genius,</br>
  but it will significantly increase ones processing ability.</br>
  Someone who is near-genius may very well have a breakthrough.</br>
  Imagine standardizing these behaviors across a generation and seeing the entire bell curve shift.</br>
